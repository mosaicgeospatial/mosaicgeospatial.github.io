Geoscape have released the February 2021 update of GNAF. This release adds 57,869 new addresses, making the total number of addresses in GNAF now 15,038,589. Our GNAF products have now been updated to use the new data.

## GNAF File Geodatabase and Shapefiles
The [GNAF File Geodatabase and Shapefile](https://www.mosaicgeospatial.com/gnaf_fgdb_shapefile) versions of the source GNAF dataset are available from our [GitHub site](https://github.com/mosaicgeospatial/gnaf-file-geodatabase-shapefile){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Also included are simplified, consolidated feature classes where the main parts of the GNAF dataset have been combined into easy, ready to use feature classes. All states have been merged together and attributes reformatted and joined. Suitable for everyone who wants to get up and running with GNAF quickly.
